# Particles platform

This is the metapackage for the core Particles platform (Coming soon...)

Particles aims to be a platform more than a framework. Based on the [Scatter](https://github.com/mariocasciaro/scatter)
dependency injection container, it will provide the user total flexibility to build customized frameworks and
applications by combining different components (particles).
